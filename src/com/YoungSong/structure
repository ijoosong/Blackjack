This is how I would structure it.

class players
 - name
 - chips/money
 - cards
 
class cards
 - suit
 - value
 - shuffle

blackjack_gameplay.java
 - add players
 - remove players
 - deal hands
 - hit/split/double down/stand
 
Change each of the "big" parts of code to smaller parts so that you can test better.
Try to take any function or if/else statement that's longer than 20 lines and make it into multiple functions that you can call.
Then start to test afterwards.
